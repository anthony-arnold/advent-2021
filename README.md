# Advent of Code - 2021

This time, all in [Haskell](https://haskell.org).

## Usage

Use the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/index.html) to compile a particular day's solution. Pass the puzzle input into stdin and get the answers on stdout.

    $ gch ./DayXX.hs
    $ ./DayXX < ./DayXX.txt
